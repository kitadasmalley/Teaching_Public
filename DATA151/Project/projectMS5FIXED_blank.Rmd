## Distributions, Summary Statistics, and Comparing Subgroups


### STEP 0: Import the data


```{r}
## CALL THE DATA IN 

## INSERT CODE HERE ##
```


### PART 1: Motivating Question 1

State a question of interest for one numeric variable

STATE YOUR QUESTION OF INTEREST HERE. 

### STEP 1: Create a histogram to show a numeric distribution. Try different numbers of bins.

```{r}
## MAKE HISTOGRAM

## INSERT CODE HERE ##
```

### STEP 2: Create a boxplot to show a numeric distribution.

```{r}
## MAKE A BOXPLOT

## INSERT CODE HERE ##
```

### STEP 3: Create a density to show a numeric distribution.

```{r}
## MAKE A DENSITY PLOT

## INSERT CODE HERE ##
```

### STEP 4: Discuss your findings

Describe the shape of the distribution
  * Skew vs symmetry, 
  * Modes (unimodal or multimodal)
  * Outliers

PLEASE DISCUSS YOUR FINDINGS HERE

### STEP 5: Summary statistics

```{r}
## SUMMARY STATISTICS
# If skewed, give median and quartiles
# If roughly symmetric, give mean and sd

## INSERT CODE HERE ##
```


### PART 2: Motivating Question 2

State a question of interest exploring the relationship between one numeric variables and one categorical variable

STATE YOUR QUESTION OF INTEREST HERE. 

### STEP 1: Side-by-Side Box Plot

Create graphic showing subgroups (ie showing how a numeric distribution may vary depending on a categorical variable)

```{r}
## MAKE A SIDE-by-SIDE BOXPLOT

## INSERT CODE HERE ##
```


### STEP 2: Discuss your findings
