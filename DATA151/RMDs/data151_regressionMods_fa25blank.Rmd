### Learning Objectives

Students will learn how to use linear regression to model relationships between variables and also explore subgroups. 



### Example 1: Climate Change and Fish Habitats

As the climate grows warmer, we expect many animal species to move toward the poles in an attempt to maintain their preferred temperature range.

Do data on fish in the North Sea confirm this suspicion?

The data are 25 years of mean winter temperatures at the bottom of the North Sea (degrees Celsius) and the center of the distribution of anglerfish (sometimes called monkfish) in degrees of north latitude.

#### Step 0: Tidyverse

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

#### Step 1: Load the data into R. Create a data frame.

```{r}
# EXAMPLE: Climate Change and Fish Habitats
# Data on anglerfish distribution
# Explanatory: Temp in C (mean winter temperature at bottom of North Sea)
# Response: Latitude of center for distribution of anglerfish

year<-c(1977:2001)
temp<-c(6.26, 6.26, 6.27, 6.31, 6.34, 6.32, 6.37, 6.39, 6.42, 
        6.52, 6.68, 6.76, 6.78, 6.89, 6.90, 6.93, 6.98, 
        7.02, 7.09, 7.13, 7.15, 7.29, 7.34, 7.57, 7.65)
lat<-c(57.20, 57.96, 57.65, 57.59, 58.01, 59.06, 56.85, 56.87, 57.43,
       57.72, 57.83, 57.87, 57.48, 58.13, 58.52, 58.48, 57.89,
       58.71, 58.07, 58.49, 58.28, 58.49, 58.01, 58.57, 58.90)

# Make a dataframe
fish<-data.frame(year, temp, lat)
```

#### Step 2: Look at the data! Create a scatterplot!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# Scatterplot of data looks linear

## YOUR CODE HERE ##
```

Describe the relationship: 

* direction – positive or negative
* form – linear or non-linear
* strength – strong (points close together) or weak (points spread out)
* outliers - an individual value that falls outside the overall pattern of the relationship

#### Step 3: Create a simple linear model


```{r}
# Fit a simple linear model 
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
```

#### Step 4: Add the fitted line to the scatterplot


```{r}
# Scatterplot with fitted line
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
```


### Example 2: Amazon Shipping

When you buy a book off Amazon, you get a quote for how much it costs to ship. This is based on the weight of the book. If you didn’t know the weight of the book, what other characteristics of it could you measure to help predict the weight?

#### Step 1: Load the Data

```{r}
#install.packages("DAAG")
library(DAAG)
data(allbacks)

books <- allbacks[, c(3, 1, 4)]

## LOOK AT THE TOP OF THE DATA
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
```

#### Step 2: Look at the data

```{r}
# Scatterplot of all books together
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
```

#### Step 3: Create a simple linear model

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
```

#### Step 4: Add the fitted line to the scatterplot

```{r}
# Scatterplot of all books together and fitted model
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
```

#### Step 5: Explore possible subgroups

What about considering cover type in the model?

```{r}
# What about considering cover type 
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
```

Would there be different equations for the models? 

```{r}
## INSERT CODE HERE ##
```

#### Interactions?!

How does this work in the model?  This is called an interaction, which means that the relationship between `x` and `y` varies depending on the levels of a variable.  

It can be modeled by using the following code: 

```{r}
# Include interaction to shift intercept and change slope
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
```
