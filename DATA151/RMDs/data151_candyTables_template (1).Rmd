Read the fivethirtyeight article and watch the short movie

https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/

Here’s some documentation on these data:

https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/candy-power-ranking

#### Step 0: Load the Data

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
candy<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv",
 header=TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```


#### Step 1: Structure

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
```
#### Step 2: One-way Table

How many candies have chocolate? 

```{r}
# 1 = Yes Chocolate
# 0 = No Chocolate

## INSERT YOUR CODE HERE ##
```

What is the probability if you randomly choose a candy it will have chocolate? 

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
```


#### Step 3: Simple Bar Graph (1-Var)

Simple Bar Graph: 

```{r}
candy$chocolate<-as.factor(candy$chocolate)

## YOUR CODE HERE ##

```


#### Step 4: Two-way table

How many candies have chocolate and caramel?

```{r}
# Row = Chocolate
# Col = Caramel

## INSERT CODE HERE ##

```

If I randomly selected a candy, what is the probability that its chocolate and caramel? 

```{r}
# Joint
## YOUR CODE HERE ##

```
If I randomly selected a candy and it was chocolate, what is the probability that its chocolate and caramel? 

```{r}
# Conditional
## YOUR CODE HERE ##

```

#### Step 5: Bar Graphs with 2-Vars

Bar Graphs with Two Variables: 

```{r}
candy$caramel<-as.factor(candy$caramel)

# stacked
## YOUR CODE HERE ##

# dodge
## YOUR CODE HERE ##

# fill
## YOUR CODE HERE ##

```
